# Item List Manager

## Description
Item List Manager is a simple React application that allows users to add, view, and manage items in a list. The app displays a list of items in an unordered list (`<ul>`), and includes an input field and a button to add new items to the list. The app features a dark theme with white text, designed to provide a modern, visually pleasing experience.

## Features
- Add items to the list.
- Clear the input field after adding an item.
- Handle empty input gracefully (does not add items if the input is empty).
- Dark theme with a responsive design for both mobile and desktop screens.
